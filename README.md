# logger-snippets
VS Code snippets for PL/SQL Developer users of Logger

## Introduction

See my [blog post](http://www.grassroots-oracle.com/2018/04/logger-snippets-for-vs-code.html) regarding the usage of a snippets file in VS Code, to help faster entry of common lines of code in your PL/SQL packages.

## Setup Instructions

1) Use ctrl-shift-P to start typing in a command "Snippets", aiming for Configure Snippets, as to create (or amend) a snippets file.

2) Add the JSON to the file.

3) Back in your PL/SQL file, start typing 'log' to get auto-complete options.
